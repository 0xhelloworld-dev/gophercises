* Need to consider how we're gonna solve


* Script Functionality:
    * Track which pages have already been parsed
    * Use our linkparser package and run it on every page
    * Build a http client that will take in either fqdn (https://domain.com) or relative link: (/about-us)
        * or we can only store things as full path https://domain.com and disregard relative paths
* User input
    * accepts a domain "https://google.com" and will go through and try to parse all the links
